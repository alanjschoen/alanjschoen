title: Scraping the search box on IMDB with Selenium
published: true
---

IMDB has an awesome auto-complete search box.  Type some words in it, and it immediately shows you a list of movies that match your search.  I wanted to see which movies I could find on IMDB without actually loading each page, so I decided to scrape information right out of the search box.

{% include image_topcaption_tall.html url="/assets/imdb_box/thething.png" description="Example: searching for a great movie on IMDB" %}

This is beyond the capability of wget or requests, since the search box is implemented in Javascript, and they just download inactive HTML.  I needed full browser capabilities, so I used Selenium to create a robotic instance of Firefox and scrape from it.

In order to use selenium, you need to download a driver first.  I used a chrome driver, which I downloaded from [the Selenium website](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/).  The driver is contained in a file called `chromedriver` which I put in the same directory as the python script.

Then you can import the driver

```python
import os
from selenium import webdriver
chromedriver = "./chromedriver"
os.environ["webdriver.chrome.driver"] = chromedriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome(chromedriver)
```

Then you can open a page in Selenium.  This will open an actual web browser, but a special 'robo-browser' that you can control from within python.  For example, you can tell it to navigate to the page for 'The Thing':

```python
thing_url = "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/"
driver.get(thing_url)
```

Now we need to select the search box so we can work with it.  To do this, let's look at the loaded page and right click the search box to inspect it.

{% include image_topcaption_tall.html url="/assets/imdb_box/source.png" description="Inpect the search box source" %}

The search box's id is `navbar-query`.  Let's select that element by id using Selenium:

```
searchbox = driver.find_element_by_id("navbar-query")
```

Now we can click on it and enter some text:

```python
searchbox.click()
searchbox.send_keys("The Thing")
```

And the drop-down list appears! Inspecting the HTML like before, we find that it's called `navbar-suggestionsearch`, so let's select that element by id and have a look at the HTML

```python
sug_html = driver.find_element_by_id('navbar-suggestionsearch').get_attribute('innerHTML')
print sug_html
```

I don't like to work with Selenium to parse out data.  It's a little tedious to use, and I don't want to have to memorize a whole new set of functions, so I'd prefer to work with Beautiful Soup.  So I'll pass that raw HTML along to Beautiful Soup and then parse out the data I'm interested in.

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
soup=BeautifulSoup(sug_html, 'lxml')

title = [x.text for x in soup.find_all('span', { "class" : "title" })]
year = [x.text for x in soup.find_all('span', { "class" : "extra" })]
detail = [x.text for x in soup.find_all('div', { "class" : "detail" })]
link = [x['href'] for x in soup.find_all('a')]

suggested_movies = zip(title, year, detail, link[:-1])
```

We got what we came for!

```python
[('The Thing', '(1982)', 'Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley', '/title/tt0084787/?ref_=nv_sr_1'),
 ('The Thing', '(2011)', 'Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Joel Edgerton', '/title/tt0905372/?ref_=nv_sr_2'),
 ('The Thing from Another World', '(1951)', 'Kenneth Tobey, Margaret Sheridan', '/title/tt0044121/?ref_=nv_sr_3'),
 ('The Thing Called Love', '(1993)', 'River Phoenix, Samantha Mathis', '/title/tt0108327/?ref_=nv_sr_4'),
 ('The Thing with Two Heads', '(1972)', 'Roosevelt Grier, Ray Milland', '/title/tt0069372/?ref_=nv_sr_5')]
```

Don't let the door hit you on the way out:

```python
driver.close()
```
