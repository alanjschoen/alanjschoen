### Bio

Software developer/scientist currently working in New York.  I have a bachelors degree in Physics and Computer Science and I earned my masters in computational neuroscience at McGill University in Montreal.  My research interests mainly focus on economics and image processing.

I have an unusual love for hiking, which lead me to hike the entire Appalachian Trail in 2015.

### Publications

[A Compartmental Model of Linear Resonance and Signal Transfer in Denderites](https://www.academia.edu/9098894/A_Compartmental_Model_of_Linear_Resonance_and_Signal_Transfer_in_Dendrites)  
This paper covers my masters thesis research.  I studied how neurons work as computational units.  Experimental reserach in the last two decades has shown that single neurons are capable of many more complicated calculations than the simple sum-threshold model that forms the basis for artificial neural nets.  My thesis work attempted to reduce some of this reserach into a simple model and make predictions about what this meant for the structure of neural computation.

[Tracking Toads Using Photo Identification and Image Recogntion Software](https://www.academia.edu/22347075/Tracking_Toads_Using_Photo_Identification_and_Image-Recognition_Software)  
I worked with David Green's lab at McGill University to build a system that used image processing to 'fingerprint' Fowler's Toads.  Our approach was a humane alternative to toe-clipping.
