<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Animals often have individually-specific patterns of natural markings that can be used to identify them without harm. Employing these patterns effectively for recognizing individuals requires photographs, a searchable archive for the photographs and an expeditious means of comparing the photographs to find matching patterns. For a small number of individuals, all that may be required is a set of photographic prints that can be searched by eye. But for larger numbers of individuals that have been photographed multiple times, manual searching rapidly becomes prohibitively time-consuming and the method therefore requires digital photographs stored in a digital archive, searched by image-recognition software. The design of such software is not trivial. Animals vary in size, shape and color; markings on the animals vary position, size and shape; photographs of the animals vary in quality, orientation and pixel density. We have designed an algorithm for such an automated software system for image-based visual recognition of individual animals. We have named the system “Foto-spottr” and deployed it effectively in the field with Fowler's Toads, Anaxyrus fowleri. A system such as this represents a significant technical and ethical advance in field methods, particularly for small animals such as amphibians.</p>

<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p>Dendrites carry signals between synapses and the soma and play a cen- tral role in neural computation. Although they contain many nonlinear ion channels, their signal-transfer properties are linear under some ex- perimental conditions. In experiments with continuous-time inputs, a resonant linear two-port model has been shown to provide a near-perfect fit to the dendrite-to-soma input-output relationship. In this study, we fo- cused on this linear aspect of signal transfer using impedance functions that replace biophysical channel models in order to describe the elec- trical properties of the dendritic membrane. The membrane impedance model of dendrites preserves the accuracy of the two-port model with minimal computational complexity. Using this approach, we demon- strate two membrane impedance profiles of dendrites that reproduced the experimentally observed two-port results. These impedance profiles demonstrate that the two-port results are compatible with different com- putational schemes. In addition, our model highlights how dendritic resonance can minimize the location-dependent attenuation of signals at the resonant frequency. Thus, in this model, dendrites function as linear- resonant filters that carry signals between nonlinear computational units.</p>
