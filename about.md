Software developer/scientist currently working in New York.  I have a bachelors degree in Physics and Computer Science and I earned my masters in computational neuroscience at McGill University in Montreal.  My research interests mainly focus on economics and image processing.

I have an unusual love for hiking, which lead me to hike the entire Appalachian Trail in 2015.
