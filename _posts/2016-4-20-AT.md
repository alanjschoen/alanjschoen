My goal is to locate people on the AT, so the first thing I need is a good map of the AT.  Fortunately, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy (ATC) maintains GIS data describing the path of the AT and makes it available on its website.  I was hoping to get started by downloading the GIS data, and then converting it to a format that I can use more easily.  However, I found out that that wasn't going to be straight forward.

The ATC distributes <a href="http://www.appalachiantrail.org/home/explore-the-trail/gis-data" target="_blank">GIS data</a> in shapefiles, the format used by most GIS software, like ArcGIS and QGIS.  The shapefile format is regulated by the ESRI, which published <a href="https://www.esri.com/library/whitepapers/pdfs/shapefile.pdf" target="_blank">documentation</a> about it.  Shapefiles are a mixtures of headers and binary data.  Fortunately, I did not have to write my own program to read them because there are many open-source options available.  Fiona, Django, and Pandas all have functions for reading shapefiles.  I decided to use <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyshp" target="_blank">Pyshp</a> because it's simple and it only has the features I need with nothing extra.

The ATC shares three shapefile documents describing the AT, one showing the centerline, one with shelters, and one for parking.  I started with the centerline, because that's the one showing the course of the AT.  So I loaded the centerline using Pyshp and had a look.  The first thing I noticed is that the centerline file is divided into 3,357 sections. The average section is less then a mile long, but some of them are longer.  Here is the distribution of section lengths in a histogram.

The bulk of the sections are very short.  The longest section is 10.3 miles.  So it seems the trail is broken into very small pieces. I tried plotting the course of the AT, and here's what I got.

Clearly something is wrong.

First, the sections of the AT are not in any particular order.  My first thought was that maybe I'm reading the shapefile wrong.  So I had a look at the ESRI documentation, and I found that there was a an order label on each section.  I had a look at Pyshp and saw that it was discarding the order number.  So I modified it to include the order as a field... and I found out that the order number was the same order I was getting anyway.  So it seems the problem is that the ATC's centerline data does not include an order parameter so I have to order the segments myself.  I thought of a simple algorithm to do this: following the AT course like a hiker.  Starting at springer mountain, I can look for the segment that connects.  Then I can follow that trail segment to the end and look for the segment that connects there.  So I wrote a program to do that and I got this result

Much better, but something is still wrong.  The AT is ending in Vermont, and some of the areas in New England look a little thick.  So I had a closer look, plotting the segments as they were connected in the first few iterations of my program.  I marked the current position with a black circle, and two candidates for the next segment in red and blue.  The ends of the segments are marked with triangles.

Everything looks good so far.  I have the next segment in red, and the next-next segment in blue.  So I move a little up the trail and...

Ah ha!

Not all of the segments are ordered northbound!  So I have to make my program a little more complicated, and try all the segments forwards and backwards.  Here is the result:

Everything's great! Right?  Well there is one small problem.  There are still 7 segments left over.  That is, when my algorithm was connecting segments, it didn't find any use for 7 of the trail segments.  They're just left out.  It's like assembling a microscope and then seeing 7 screws lying on the table.  Think those are important?

And another thing.  Some of the gaps between segments are a little big.  The biggest is 5.9 miles, which is alarming since I don't think any gap should be larger than 100 feet.  There's not much I can do about this for now, except mark the anomalies and try to figure them out later.
